C:\\&gt; START DAVID.EXE

**Glowing sub-basement corridor**, somewhere in Maryland, USA (indoors).

&gt; LOOK

You are in a dark room suffused by the glow of computer monitors. Bright
green blinking TX/RX activity LEDs pierce through the darkness at a
high frequency. A faint beat of some kind can be heard, undoubtedly
leaking from a set of open-back headphones, interrupting an otherwise
ambient sonic backdrop of PWM fans and coil whine.

There are no discernable exits.

**David** is here.

&gt; LOOK David

Clearly a ~~degenerate~~ developer or nerd of some kind, given his
aversion to daylight, sleep deprivation, and obsession with obnoxiously
loud mechanical typing devices.

Your neural implant has reached out to the vapornet and come up with
the following data points:

- David is primarily a software developer, but has experience serving
  in a variety of capacities, including cybersecurity, web development,
  cloud infrastructure, platform, and SRE.
- David is allergic to spaghetti code, and is almost obsessive
  compulsive about software and security standards and best practices.
- David has a penchant for collecting obscene amounts of mechanical
  keyboards, keycaps, and other keyboard accessories.
- David thinks people who describe themselves in the third person are
  full of it.
